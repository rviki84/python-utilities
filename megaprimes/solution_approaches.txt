megaprimes.py
=============
1. Iterate over odd numbers divided by all numbers from 2 to (odd-1) and look for non-zero reminders.
2. Then filter out the megaprimes by excluding primes from step 1 with any digits containing [0,1,4,6,8,9]


megaprimesOpt.py
================
1. Iterate over odd numbers divided by all primes from 2 to (odd-1) and look for non-zero reminders.
2. Then filter out the megaprimes by excluding primes from step 1 with any digits containing [0,1,4,6,8,9]

This approach is bit optimised, "works better" as the divisors are primes and not all integers


megaprimesFast.py
=================
1. Even better algorithm but generating just the megaprimes.
2. It first generates the possible megaprime combinations (which is far far less in count than prime) using [2,3,5,7] set and checks for prime condition.

The result for 10^9 is noted in the code result section as comment.
